# Vite FS Routing

This repo contains examples of, how [ViteJS](https://vitejs.dev/) can be used for file-system
based routing, similar to that of [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing) and [Astro](https://docs.astro.build/en/core-concepts/routing/) in your simple
react application.
